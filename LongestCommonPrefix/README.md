# Longest Common Prefix using Sorting

Problem Statement: Given a set of strings, find the longest common prefix.

Examples:

Input: {"geeksforgeeks", "geeks", "geek", "geezer"}
Output: "gee"

Input: {"apple", "ape", "april"}
Output: "ap"

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The longest common prefix for an array of strings is the common prefix between 2 most dissimilar strings. For example, in the given array {“apple”, “ape”, “zebra”}, there is no common prefix because the 2 most dissimilar strings of the array “ape” and “zebra” do not share any starting characters.
